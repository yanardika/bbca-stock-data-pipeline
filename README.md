# BBCA Stock Data Pipeline
An end-to-end financial data pipeline for BBCA (Bank Central Asia) stock data, covering data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, and preparation of a modeling-ready dataset for machine learning and time-series forecasting.

Built a modular financial data pipeline transforming raw BBCA market data into a machine learning-ready dataset with engineered technical and fundamental indicators.
This project demonstrates practical skills in data engineering, financial data analysis, and ML-ready dataset construction.

# Project Overview
This repository contains a complete data preparation pipeline for stock price analysis and machine learning modeling using BBCA stock data.
The pipelines include:
1. Data Collection / Scraping
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Technical Indicator Engineering
4. Fundamental Data Integration
5. Dataset Merging & Final Preparation for Modeling
The final output is a structured dataset ready for time-series forecasting or machine learning models.
